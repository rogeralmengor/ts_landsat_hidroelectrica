## Installation
The code is to be executed in the code editor of Google Earth Engine.
Nothing needs to be installed. You only have a gmail account.
More information regarding Google Earth Engine: 
https://developers.google.com/earth-engine 

## Usage
You can use the code to generate time series animation in gif format for landsat 7 imagery. There is other dataframes
such as Sentinel-2 to use them for the generation of timelapse animations. With changes on the image collection or 
the geometry you can make use of this code for your own project. This code has been developed by creating two-year
composites on Landsat-7 imagery, in a false color composite using the near infrared, red and green bands. 
This animation was created as support for the blog post on my website:<br>

## Dependencies
This timelapse uses the *text* package developed by  Gennadii Donchyts, to add text on every frame on the animation.
